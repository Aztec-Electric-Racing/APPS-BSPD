APPS/BSPD Firmware for the STM32F4 MCU
By JT Rollinson and Jack Varagas

This current commit is for the Nucleo test board and I will be updating it to hopefully work with the actual chip.
Additionally the APPS calculations and the EEPROM memory functions are on two separate files for testing purposes, but I will be combining them as well in a future commit.

The folders should contain all the necessary dependancies but some C libraries may have  problems. (untested)

Also I am using the master branch as I was unable to commit to the main branch for some reason.
